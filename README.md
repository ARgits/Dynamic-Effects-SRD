# Dynamic-Effects-SRD
A compendium pack for SRD items, spells, feats etc configured for use with Dynamic Active Effects, MQoL, Furnace and About Time
--

### Anything with an X next to the name is currently broken

### DAE is 100% required.

### MQoL and Furnace are needed for auto effect application 
Effects without macro calls do not need Furnace. For MQoL, the setting "Auto apply Active Effects to targets" must be enabled for any "Active Effect" to correctly apply to the target.

### About Time is required for auto effect removal.
Without About Time (or for effects that finish before their full time; navigate to the Active Effects tab of the effected actor and remove the Active Effect manually.

## Core Macros
To use any of the macro style effects you **must** import the following macros from the compendium: 
* ActorSetFlag
* ActorUnSetFlag
* ActorGetFlag
* ActorUpdate
* TokenUpdate
* CUB control




**V0.05** Level 1 spells and cantrips finished

**V0.0.6** Most SRD Items finished, excluding more complicated macro items

**V0.0.7** Spell macros cleaned up, spell removal macro added and spell storage method moved to actor.data to save between scenes

**V0.1.0** Most higher level spells without macro effects have been added. Macros now have the option to be stored within the item itself (thanks to the Item Macro functionality)  
**V0.2.0** Updated to DAE and 0.7.5 compatability, removed item macros (you can add/edit them yourself if you really need to)
