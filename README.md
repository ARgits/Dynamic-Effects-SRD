# Dynamic-Effects-SRD
A compendium pack for SRD items, spells, feats etc configured for use with Dynamic Effects, Midi QoL, Furnace and About Time
DE is 100% required.

Midi QoL and Furnace (with advanced macros enabled) are needed for auto effect application (effects without macro calls do not need Furnace).

About Time is required for auto effect removal. 


Spells are drag/drop onto actors. 
I suggest importing all the macros to directory to avoid any issues.


V0.05 Level 1 spells and cantrips finished
V0.0.6 Most SRD Items finished, excluding more complicated macro items
