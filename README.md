# Dynamic-Effects-SRD
A compendium pack for SRD items, spells, feats etc configured for use with Dynamic Effects, Midi QoL, Furnace and About Time
DE is 100% required.

Midi QoL and Furnace (with advanced macros enabled) are needed for auto effect application (effects without macro calls do not need Furnace).

About Time is required for auto effect removal.


Without About Time (or for effects that finish before their full time (concentration broken etc) there is a SpellRemoval macro
that will give a popup-selection of what macro-style effects are currently on the target selecting the appropriate one, and clicking "OK" will remove the effects.

For non-macro effects, there is a macro in the standard DE macro compendium for removal of active effects.


----------------------------
Spells are drag/drop onto actors. 
I suggest importing all the macros to directory to avoid any issues.


V0.05 Level 1 spells and cantrips finished
V0.0.6 Most SRD Items finished, excluding more complicated macro items
V0.0.7 Spell macros cleaned up, spell removal macro added and spell storage method moved to actor.data to save between scenes
